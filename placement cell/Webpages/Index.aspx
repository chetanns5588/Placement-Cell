We prepare our students thoroughly, so that they can be confident and impressive when the placement season arrives. Some of our initiatives that facilitate placements include CEO talks, corporate seminars, industry academia conferences, workshops, skills enhancement programs, personality grooming, mock interviews, etc.

We aims at providing perfect ambience to budding professionals so as to enable them to carve a unique niche in their upcoming field. Clarity of concept, confidence, discipline, boldness, motivation and a desire to excel are inculcated in them as a part and parcel of the curriculum, besides grooming them to become learned professionals. For them striving for perfection as well as excellence has become as much a part of their personality as is gaining knowledge in their respective fields.
